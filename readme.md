Many students face financial challenges when it comes to paying for their education, textbooks, research projects, or study abroad programs. A crowdfunding platform allows students to create campaigns and seek financial support from a wider community, including family, friends, alumni, and even strangers who are passionate about education. This CrowdFunding app can help bridge the financial gap and enable students to pursue their educational goals.

Any contributor can log into the site and connect their wallet using BeaconWallet. Here in the screenshot, we have used temple wallet.

After Wallet is connected, the user can enter the amount that they want to contribute, and press  on update amount button. They need to click on Contribute button to begin the transaction.

After the transaction is finished , a successful transaction will display the above message.

Remarks:
Contract includes a withdraw transaction function which was not completed before time.
It also includes a goal achieved variable and end transaction functionality which would have stopped the crowdfunding after reaching a particular goal.
